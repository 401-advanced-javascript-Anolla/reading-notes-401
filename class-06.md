#  HTTP and REST

- The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless request-response application layer protocol.
-  Applications built using HTTP subscribe to the client-server computing model. In the client-server computing model a host designed to provide a service is called a server. Clients are hosts that make requests to that service.

## HTTP Requests

- The first line of the request contains the METHOD, URL, and HTTP VERSION.
- HEADERS: A header is a key value pair separated using a colon.
- An optional body follows the header section.

## HTTP Response

- The first line of the response contains the HTTP VERSION, STATUS CODE, and STATUS MESSAGE.
- HEADERS: A header is a key value pair separated using a colon.
- An optional body follows the header section.

# REST

- Is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer.
- Rest uses a common set of methods (called “verbs”) to operate on the state of a resource (“noun”), generally using HTTP as the transfer protocol.
