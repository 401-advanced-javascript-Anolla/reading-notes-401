## How to Solve Programming Problems

1. Make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.

2. Don't tru to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

3. Read the problem completely twice: very important step
- If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.
- It’s very important that when you solve a problem manually, you recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem.  You may need to write out all the things you are normally storing in your head.  You want to be aware of each step, it is easy to gloss over them. (explain the step and why did you do it.)

4. Optimize the manual solution:
- What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.
- Look how close we are getting to code at this point.  You should be tempted to actually write the code for this.  That is good, it tells you that you have solved and simplified the problem well.  Writing code should now become very easy.

5. Write pseudo-code or comments:
- Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation.
- If you are a beginner or struggle with these kinds of problems, I would go ahead and take the time to do this step anyway though.
- What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

6. Replace comments with real code:
- This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.
- All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

**If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:**
You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion

7. Optimize the real code:
- Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler. A word of advice here is not to get too tricky.  Just try to mainly simplify your code and get rid of duplication.


* Many times you will find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated.  In those instances, you will want to try and find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process above for each half.

This method of tackling a problem is called “divide and conquer” and is quite effective.  A good way to know where to break a problem in half is to think about what part of the problem if already given to you would make solving the rest easy.

## Living in frenzy is a sign we’ve squandered too much.

- Many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission.
The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.
They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take.
They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective.
See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.

## How to think like a programmer

1. Understand: Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them.
2. Plan: To get a good plan, answer this question:
“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments!

3. Divide: Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.
Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.”— V. Anton Spraul

4. Stuck? 
Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
“The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer

5. Practice: what you should do is find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy).
