# Stacks and Queues

## A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

#### Stacks follow these concepts:

- FILO
  - First In Last Out
  - This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

- LIFO
  - Last In First Out
  - This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## Queues are based on the FIFO principle, i.e., the element inserted at the first, is the first element to come out of the list.
